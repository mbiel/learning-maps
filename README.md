Playing with Placester and Google Maps APIs

The goal is to be able to:
    1) place markers appropriately within the map bounds
    2) allow the user to draw a polygon on the map, zoom and center on the polygon, and only display listings within the polygon
    3) allow the user to right click on a marker and save the listing as a 'favorite'. The marker color should change and favorites should persist on page reload.

This will only function until the Placester API key expires, at which point I will need a new data source.
